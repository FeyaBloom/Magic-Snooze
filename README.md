# 💜 Magic Snooze

**A productivity app that doesn't punish you.**

*Made with ❤️ for the ADHD community and anyone tired of guilt-driven to-do apps.*

## What is Magic Snooze?

Magic Snooze is a productivity and wellness app designed with **ADHD in mind** (but useful for anyone). My core philosophy is simple: **track progress, not failure**. I assume you're already doing your best and provide structure without rigidity or shame.

Unlike traditional habit trackers that break your streak and make you feel terrible, I celebrate small wins, protect your consistency on bad days, and make rest **part of the system** instead of a failure.

## Why Magic Snooze? ✨

**💤 Snooze Days & Weekly Freeze**  
Intentionally pause for a day (Snooze) or get automatic protection once per week (Freeze). Your streaks remain intact. Because life happens.

**🎉 Tiny Victories**  
Celebrate 8 micro-accomplishments: drank water? Had a talk? Took a break? Each deserves confetti. No achievement is too small.

**🔔 Gentle Notifications**  
Soft reminders only when helpful. No aggressive pings. No anxiety. You can disable them entirely—I won't guilt trip you.

**💾 Privacy-First**  
All your data stays on your device. No login, no tracking, no servers. It's your journey, your data.

## Philosophy 💜

I built Magic Snooze because traditional productivity apps made me feel worse, not better. They punish inconsistency, create anxiety with aggressive notifications, and focus relentlessly on what you *didn't* do.

**My philosophy:**
- **ADHD-friendly first:** Structure without rigidity. Celebrate without pressure.
- **No guilt, no shame:** Rest is productive. Pausing is valid. You're not failing.
- **Progress over perfection:** Small wins matter. Showing up imperfectly beats not showing up at all.
- **Privacy and respect:** Your data is yours. No tracking, no login, no judgment.

This app is my love letter to anyone who's ever felt broken by a to-do list.
