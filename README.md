Magic Snooze 

A productivity app that makes stopping safe.

Most productivity systems are built around momentum.
Magic Snooze is built around recovery.
Real life has dips — low-energy days, executive dysfunction, burnout, emotional overload.
Those moments shouldn’t erase your progress or force you to start from zero.
Consistency shouldn’t collapse because you needed rest.
Magic Snooze protects your continuity — even when you can’t show up.

What you can actually do

💤 Snooze Day
Pause everything intentionally.
Routines, streaks, stats — frozen and safe.
No penalty. No reset. No shame.

🧊 Weekly Freeze
If a day passes with zero activity, your system absorbs it — once per week.
Because life happens.

✨ Notice tiny victories
Yes, “I got up” counts.
“Yes, I ate.” counts.
Small actions matter more than perfect streaks.

⏰️ Routines
Use ready-made morning and evening routines or build your own.
Add. Remove. Adjust anytime.
Structure without rigidity.

✅ Tasks
Add one-time tasks with optional dates.
Keep things simple.
No complex project boards. No overwhelm.
Tasks live alongside routines — so your day feels coherent, not fragmented.

🏅 Weekly & Monthly Reflections
Stats focus on what you did.
Encouraging insights.
Medals for steady effort — not perfection.

🌸 Tiny Victories Garden
Every completed mini-action grows something.
You don’t see what you missed.
You see what you nurtured.

📝 Notes with search
Capture thoughts, plans, brain-dumps.
Find them instantly when your mind jumps elsewhere.

🎨 Calm, intentional design
Soft gradients. Smooth animations. Thoughtful typography.
Minimal functionality. Strong aesthetic.
A shuffle button for a small visual reset when you need it.

🔔 Gentle reminders

No chaotic pop-ups. No gamified pressure.
Just quiet support when you need it.
